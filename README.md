# ConsoleQuest
The Quest for Total Consrtrol

Created and designed by Kenneth Needham.

Essentially this project is going to be a console based RPG. Taking in RNG aspects of DnD 
and the adventure aspect of most Modern RPG games.
I am going to use this to teach myself coding in C#, and it will initially be quite simple but
I am trying to make it as complex as I can without over doing it....so to speak.

**<-- Indecates Story.
*Features*
Roll = Determine outcome
Input = Required Feilds

//Apoligies for bad spelling...


**ConsoleQuest will start you off in a dungeon as a prisoner, you have been convicted of many crimes
and you are a somewhat renouned person. The reasoning for your imprisonment has to do with the corupt
legal system your provance currently upholds. You will be greeted by and old mental patiant "Bryan" 
he will tell you about all the things you need to know. "Bryan" will be the introduction to the game, 
explaining rules and how things will be determaned.**  

There will be a *Roll* feature in the game to help determine the paths that you take.
The player, at points of the game will be asked to input *Info* and this will be used
to customise the adventure.
